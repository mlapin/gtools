gt-config(1)
============

NAME
----
gt-config - Create a user config file

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'gt config' [--help] [options]

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
  overwrite the config file if it already exists

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a user config that can be used to override default settings.

The config is simply a bash script that is sourced by the wrapper scripts.

Warning: using the -f option to overwrite the existing config file
will NOT restore the default settings if they were overriden in the existing
file (as that file would be sourced before the new file is written).

If you need to restore to the default settings simply remove the existing
config file manually.
